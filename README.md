### Dog Breed Classifier 
The dog breed classifier is image multiclassification problem. Given a set of images that are all labeled with a single category, we are asked to build neural network to understand the characteristics of each classes and predict these breeds for a novel set of test images and measure the accuracy of the predictions.Â  At the end of this project, the code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. Here is an example of final output. 


### Plagiarism_detector

In this project, The goal is to task with building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. Detecting plagiarism is an active area of research; the task is non-trivial and the differences between paraphrased answers and original work are often not so obvious.
